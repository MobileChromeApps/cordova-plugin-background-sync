#Cordova Background Sync
Background Sync enables service worker applications to perform actions when certain conditions are achieved. For example, if you want your app to delay an action until a device has a wifi connection, you can use background sync to accomplish this. Here is an [explainer document](https://github.com/slightlyoff/BackgroundSync/blob/master/explainer.md) that goes into more detail about the purpose and usage of background sync.
